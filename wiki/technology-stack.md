# Product Outcomes Technology Stack

## Overview

Product Outcomes is an enterprise-grade, cloud-native application designed to help organizations deliver products that "WOW users while achieving business outcomes." The technology stack emphasizes outcomes over outputs, supporting mobile and web applications.

## Architecture Philosophy

- **Cloud-Native**: Designed for scalable cloud deployment
- **Enterprise-Grade**: Built for large-scale organizational use
- **Multi-Platform**: Supports mobile, web, and server-side applications
- **Outcome-Focused**: Technology choices align with delivering measurable business results
- **Monorepo**: Keeping everything together, so changes are atomic, using Nx.

NX monorepo is `app centric` repo wfolloing this defintion:
app centric repositories which are used mainly for developing applications and products. This is a common setup in companies. Such repos are characterized in having an apps and packages or libs folder, where the apps folder contains the buildable and deployable applications, while the packages or libs folder contains libraries that are specific to one or multiple applications that are being developed within the monorepo. You can still also publish some of these libs to a public registry.
