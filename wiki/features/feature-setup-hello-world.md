# Setup a Hello World App

This is a hello world app which has to run across mobile and web. The hello world message must come from the database and be shown to the user on the mobile and web apps. This hello world needs to include all the [technology stack](../technology-stack.md) items listed. Only add what is required to meet the technology stack and still be a hello world app delivering the message from the database.

## Goal

Is to setup up a working end-to-end hello world app in line with the [technology stack](../technology-stack.md). 

## Repo Layout

Need to have an Nx monorepo at the root level of the repo. 

## Development Process

**CRITICAL** - Must follow the development processes outline in the [practices.md](../practices/practices.md).
