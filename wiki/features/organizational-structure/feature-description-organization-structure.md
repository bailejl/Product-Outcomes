**Problem Statement**:
We need to capture the organization's structure so that OKRs can follow the same structure. OKRs must be tied to an organization or sub-organization. Leaders are assigned to these organizations. By having OKRs tied to organizations or sub-organizations, people can easily transition from one to the other.

**Description**:
The system starts with the top organization, which will be assigned a name before someone can be assigned to it. An application admin or the leader(s) of the organization can create sub-organizations and assign leaders to them. An Excel or CSV file should allow for easy upload of the org structure and the leaders assigned to each organization, with the correct hierarchy.

Leaders can make changes to the structure beneath them, which then needs to be approved by their leader before the change is finalized. This ensures no accidental changes are made.

**Goals**:

- Capture the structure of the organization so that OKRs can be linked to higher-level organizational OKRs.
- Provide a process to manage the structure and make significant changes, if needed
- Decouple organizations, OKRs, and people, so that individuals can easily transition between positions.

**Target Audience**:

- Organization leaders
- Application Admins
