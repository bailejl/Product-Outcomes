Product Outcomes (PO) is designed for small to large organizations to deliver products that WOW users, while achieving business outcomes. PO is an [enterprise-grade](./enterprise-grade.md), [cloud-native](./cloud-native.md), [mobile app](./mobile-app.md), [web app](./web-app.md), and [server-side](./server-side.md) that supports executives, product teams, and all layers in between.

Based on the goal, here is our [technology stack](./technology-stack.md).

PO is based on [blending OKRs, Beyond Budgeting and Quarterly Planning](./blending-okrs-beyond-budgeting-and-quarterly-planning.md)

## Why PO?

PO makes organizations highly performant by ensuring hyper-focus, reducing waste, and empowering software product teams to own business and user value for their area. These same benefits apply to the rest of the organization, as PO can support the whole, not just software product development.

Outputs are wasteful and harmful to organizations, while outcomes focus on the organization's people on the right things. When focusing on outputs when creating a software product, it:

- Adds additional software complexity
- Creates a feature factory
  - Theory X behaviors
  - Lack of ownership
  - Low morale
- A lot of low-/no-value work
- Focus on vanity measures
  The industry trend indicates that approximately 20% of software features are used, according to [Pendo research](https://www.pendo.io/resources/the-2019-feature-adoption-report/). Thus, it is easy to focus on outputs. Outcomes should focus on business and user value, which counters the industry trend and the harm of the output mindset.

Outcomes are not requirements; they are goals. This requires giving teams ownership of achieving business outcomes. Leaders can provide "requirements" to software product teams, but these are un-validated requirements. Meaning they have not been verified against a set of users to see if they move the right metrics. By empowering teams to own business outcomes, they have the power to validate all requirements before they are added to the backlog. This ensures software product teams stay focused on business and user value.

## Key Fundamentals

- [OKRs](./okrs.md)
- [Beyond Budgeting for Quarterly Adjustment](./beyond-budgeting-for-quarterly-adjustment.md)
- [Product Management](./product-management.md)
- [Portfolio Management](./portfolio-management.md)

## Features

Features fill the gap between business methodology documentation (OKRs, Beyond Budgeting, Product Management) and comprehensive technical architecture specifications.

They are identified in the wiki by the prefix `Feature:`.
