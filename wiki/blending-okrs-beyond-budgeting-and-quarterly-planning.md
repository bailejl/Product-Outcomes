## 1. Connecting Beyond Budgeting with OKRs:

Beyond Budgeting's Philosophy: Beyond Budgeting challenges the traditional, rigid annual budgeting process, advocating for dynamic resource allocation and continuous planning based on business rhythms and events rather than the calendar year.
OKRs for Strategic Alignment: OKRs provide a framework for setting clear, ambitious objectives and measurable key results that align with the organization's broader strategic vision.
Harmonizing the two: Combining these approaches involves using OKRs to define strategic priorities and guide decision-making. At the same time, Beyond Budgeting provides the adaptive framework for allocating resources and managing performance to achieve those OKRs.

## 2. Integrating Quarterly Planning with OKRs:

Quarterly OKRs: The typical quarterly cycle of OKRs aligns well with the continuous planning aspect of Beyond Budgeting.
Dynamic Resource Allocation: OKRs, combined with the Beyond Budgeting approach of dynamic financial forecasts and team autonomy, enable flexible resource allocation and adjustment based on progress toward OKRs.
Regular Review and Adaptation: The quarterly rhythm provides a structured time for reviewing progress, assessing performance against OKRs, and making necessary adjustments to plans and forecasts.

## 3. Practical Steps for Alignment:

Shift Focus to OKRs: Dedicate more time and energy to setting and reviewing OKRs, making them the central driver of strategic execution.
Cost Control within OKRs: Integrate cost management as a Key Result within relevant OKRs to ensure financial discipline is maintained within the flexible framework.
Replace Budgets with Rolling Forecasts: Use dynamic financial forecasts instead of rigid budgets, leveraging OKRs to collect data and identify performance patterns for more accurate forecasting.
Empower Teams: Grant teams autonomy in resource allocation, enabling them to make timely decisions that support their OKRs and strategic objectives.
Regular Check-ins: Conduct weekly, monthly, or quarterly check-ins (depending on the pace of growth and business rhythms) to review financial performance, OKR progress, and resource allocation.

In summary, the most effective way to align Beyond Budgeting, OKRs, and quarterly planning is to adopt a dynamic and adaptive approach, where OKRs inform strategic direction and Beyond Budgeting facilitates flexible resource management and continuous adaptation within the quarterly planning cycle.
