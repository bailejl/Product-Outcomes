Shift in how organizations approach product portfolio management. Instead of relying on traditional methods with rigid, upfront planning, advocate for a more flexible, adaptive approach focused on delivering value and responding to changing market conditions.
Here's how product portfolio management aligns:

1. Focus on Delivering Value to the Customer:
   Emphasizes that product management is about discovering products that are valuable, usable, and feasible. This customer-centric mindset should extend to portfolio management, ensuring that the entire portfolio is aligned around delivering value to the target audience.
2. Agile and Adaptive Planning:
   Critiques traditional roadmaps with fixed features and dates, advocating for a focus on vision, objectives, and outcomes, [according to Productboard](https://www.productboard.com/blog/a-review-of-inspired-the-product-management-classic-by-marty-cagan/). Product portfolio management, in this context, involves aligning investments with a clear product vision and strategy while remaining flexible enough to adjust based on learnings and market changes.
3. Empowered Teams and Decentralized Decision-Making:
   Empowered, cross-functional product teams with autonomy to solve problems, [notes Medium](https://aakashgupta.medium.com/product-management-101-marty-cagans-20-principles-for-building-great-products-c7ccc02a3ebe). At the portfolio level, this means empowering teams to contribute to decision-making and have the authority to choose how they accomplish goals.
4. Continuous Improvement and Experimentation:
   Importance of rapid experimentation, continuous learning, and validating ideas early and often, says Medium. Portfolio management should adopt a similar mindset, utilizing feedback loops and data to inform decisions and drive ongoing improvement.
5. Lean Governance and Strategy Alignment:
   Highlights the need for a clear business strategy that aligns product efforts with. This requires effective governance to ensure that investments in the product portfolio align with and support the overall business objectives.
