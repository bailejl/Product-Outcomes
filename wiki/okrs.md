Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are utilized at all levels of the organization to propel it forward toward its vision, taking into account market conditions. Collaboration is key to good OKRs, as data insights need to flow in both directions. Reality at the lower levels needs to be pushed up, so it influences OKRs. In contrast, leaders need to adjust OKRs quarterly in response to new insights; for more information, see [Beyond Budgeting for Quarterly Adjustment](https://github.com/bailejl/Product-Outcomes/wiki/Beyond-Budgeting-for-Quarterly-Adjustment). OKRs are linked from the top-level to the lowest levels of the organization.

About 5 weeks before the start of a quarter, leaders begin creating the OKRs for the upcoming quarter. A good example is [GitLab's old OKR process](https://web.archive.org/web/20240614114820/https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-okrs/). Our process is similar, but covers all levels of the organization working together to align their OKRs. Budgeting and planning allow them to drive their OKRs.
