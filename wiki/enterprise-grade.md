Core Technical Requirements:

1. Scalability

   - Horizontal scaling (adding more servers)
   - Load balancing and distributed architecture
   - Microservices or service-oriented architecture

2. Reliability & Availability

   - 99.9%+ uptime (often 99.99% or "four nines")
   - Redundancy and failover mechanisms
   - Disaster recovery and backup strategies
   - Zero-downtime deployments

3. Performance

   - Sub-second response times under load
   - Efficient database queries and indexing
   - Caching strategies (Redis, CDN)
   - Asynchronous processing for heavy tasks

4. Security

   - Authentication & authorization (OAuth, SAML, SSO)
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Role-based access control (RBAC, ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control), PBAC (Policy-Based Access Control))
   - Audit logging and compliance (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA)
   - Regular security assessments and penetration testing

5. Integration Capabilities

   - RESTful APIs and/or GraphQL with API versioning
   - Message queuing (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
   - ETL capabilities for data integration
   - Support for various protocols and standards

6. Monitoring & Observability

   - Application performance monitoring (APM)
   - Distributed tracing
   - Centralized logging
   - Real-time alerting and dashboards

7. Data Management

   - ACID compliance for critical transactions
   - Data partitioning and sharding
   - Data archival and retention policies

8. Development & Operations

   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
   - Containerization (Docker)
   - Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E with Wiremock, contract testing with Pact)
   - Documentation
