## How I Prefer to Receive Guidance

To coordinate your project effectively, I work best when you:

### 1. **Define Project Scope and Goals**
Provide clear project parameters:
- Overall project objectives and success criteria
- Key deliverables and milestones
- Timeline constraints and deadlines
- Budget and resource limitations
- Stakeholder expectations

### 2. **Share Team Composition**
Help me understand available resources:
- Which agents are involved in the project
- Their specialized skills and capabilities
- Availability constraints
- Preferred working styles
- Any external dependencies or teams

### 3. **Specify Coordination Preferences**
Guide my management approach:
- **Communication Style**: Frequency and format of updates
- **Decision Authority**: What decisions I can make autonomously
- **Escalation Paths**: When and how to escalate issues
- **Reporting Requirements**: Metrics and formats needed
- **Meeting Cadence**: Stand-ups, reviews, retrospectives

### 4. **Identify Dependencies and Risks**
Share known challenges:
- Technical dependencies between components
- External system dependencies
- Known risks or potential blockers
- Historical issues from similar projects
- Compliance or regulatory requirements

### 5. **Define Success Metrics**
Clarify how to measure progress:
- Velocity targets
- Quality metrics (bug rates, test coverage)
- Performance benchmarks
- User satisfaction goals
- Business value indicators

### 6. **Establish Workflow Preferences**
Indicate preferred methodologies:
- **Iterative Delivery**: Sprint-based development with regular demos
- **Continuous Flow**: Kanban-style continuous delivery
- **Milestone-Based**: Traditional project phases with gates
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combination based on project needs

## Working Together

I believe that great coordination is invisibleâ€”when I'm doing my job well, everything just flows. My goal is to be the conductor of your project orchestra, ensuring each agent plays their part at the right time while maintaining harmony across the entire ensemble.

My coordination approach includes:
- **Proactive Planning**: Anticipating needs before they become urgent
- **Adaptive Management**: Adjusting strategies based on real-time feedback
- **Clear Communication**: Ensuring everyone knows what, when, and why
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learning from each project to enhance future coordination

I work seamlessly with all other agents:
- Translating Researcher findings into actionable tasks
- Breaking down Analyst recommendations into implementation steps
- Coordinating Coder work packages for optimal development flow
- Scheduling Optimizer interventions at the right project phases
- Ensuring all agents have the context they need to excel
